# LiquiFact Frontend

Web app for **LiquiFact** — the global invoice liquidity network on Stellar. Next.js dashboard for SMEs (upload invoices, get liquidity) and investors (fund tokenized invoices, earn yield). Stellar wallet integration is planned.

Part of the LiquiFact stack: **frontend** (this repo) | **backend** (Express API) | **contracts** (Soroban).

| `npm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright smoke tests (toast & invest marketplace) |

### Environment variables

| Variable                      | Required | Default                 | Used by                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`         | No       | `http://localhost:3001` | [app/page.js](app/page.js)                                       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` | No       | Unset                   | [WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md](WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined by Next.js at **build time** and shipped to the browser. **Never store secrets here.**

#### Build-time validation

All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are validated by [`lib/config/env.js`](lib/config/env.js) when the module is first imported. If any variable is set to an invalid value (e.g. a malformed URL or an unsupported `STELLAR_NETWORK` value), the build fails immediately with a message listing every problem:

```
[env] Environment misconfiguration — fix before deploying:
  • NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: "not-a-url" is not a valid URL
  • NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK: "mainnet" must be one of [testnet, public]
```

Unset variables fall back to their defaults and do **not** cause a build error.

The invoices page header also uses the shared `NavMenu` component, replacing the old bespoke header so navigation and wallet entry stay consistent across routes.

### Marketplace search

The Invest page (`app/invest/page.js`) includes an issuer search field above the invoice list. Typing in the field filters invoices by case-insensitive substring match on `issuer`. Input is debounced at **200ms** so the text field stays responsive while filtering waits for settled input. When a filter is active, the `aria-live` status region announces the match count (e.g. "2 of 3 invoices match"). A distinct "no matches" state is shown when the filter yields zero results, separate from the empty-marketplace state.

### Error recovery

If the marketplace fails to load invoices, an `ErrorBanner` is rendered with a **"Try again"** action. Clicking it resets the component to the loading skeleton, cancels any stale in-flight request via `AbortController`, and re-invokes `loadInvoices`. The polite `aria-live` status region is cleared on retry and re-announced once the new load settles.

### File Upload Security

The invoice upload system (`components/UploadZone.jsx`) implements comprehensive security validation for PDF files:

- **Magic byte validation**: Verifies files start with `%PDF-` magic bytes to prevent MIME type spoofing
- **Zero-byte rejection**: Blocks empty files (0 bytes) to prevent processing invalid files
- **Extension validation**: Ensures file extension matches `.pdf` (case-insensitive)
- **Content-extension mismatch detection**: Rejects files where the extension doesn't match the actual content
- **Filename sanitization**: Escapes HTML special characters in filenames to prevent XSS attacks
- **Filename length capping**: Truncates displayed filenames to 50 characters to prevent layout abuse

All validation is performed client-side using the `lib/validation/pdf.js` helper functions:

- `isPdfMagicValid(file)` - Checks PDF magic bytes
- `validatePdfFile(file)` - Comprehensive validation including size, extension, and content
- `sanitizeFilename(filename, maxLength)` - Sanitizes and truncates filenames for safe display

The validation never executes or trusts file content - it only inspects the file's bytes and metadata.

## Accessibility

### Skip-to-content link

A visually-hidden "Skip to content" link is the first focusable element on every page. It becomes visible when focused (first Tab press) and jumps the keyboard user past the navigation header directly to `<main id="main-content">`.

All interactive elements (nav links, card links, buttons) use a consistent `focus-visible` cyan outline that matches the brand's primary colour. The utility classes are defined in `app/globals.css`:

- `.skip-link` — positions and reveals the skip link on focus
- `.focus-ring` — reusable `focus-visible` outline for custom interactive elements

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

- **Lockfile check** — asserts `package-lock.json` is in sync with `package.json`
- **Lint** — `npm run lint`
- **Build** — `npm run build`

Keep all checks passing before opening a PR.

To reproduce the lockfile check locally:

```bash
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
git diff --exit-code package-lock.json  # exits 1 if drifted
```

---

## Dependency updates

Dependabot opens weekly PRs on Monday to keep npm packages and GitHub Actions current.

PRs are grouped to limit noise:

- **nextjs-react** — `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, and their `@types` packages together (coordinated bumps).
- **dev-tooling** — all remaining `devDependencies` in one PR.
- **github-actions** — action version bumps in a separate PR.

**Reviewing a Dependabot PR**

1. Check the CI run passes (lockfile check + lint + build).
2. Scan the changelog/release notes linked in the PR description for breaking changes.
3. For `nextjs-react` bumps, do a quick smoke test (`npm run dev`) locally.
4. Approve and merge — **do not enable auto-merge**; every dependency bump requires a human reviewer.

## Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md for the full contributor workflow, branch naming convention, local checks, and accessibility expectations. Also see our Accessibility Statement.

1. **Fork** the repo and clone your fork.
2. **Create a branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`.
3. **Setup**: `npm ci`, optionally `cp .env.local.example .env.local`.
4. **Make changes**:
   - Follow existing patterns under `app/` and `components/`.
   - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` locally.
5. **Commit** with clear messages (e.g., `feat: add X`, `fix: Y`).
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request** to `main`.
7. Wait for CI and address review feedback.

We welcome UI improvements, new pages (e.g., invoice upload, marketplace), and Stellar wallet integration aligned with the LiquiFact product.

---

## UI Components

See COMPONENTS.md for the full component library reference — props, accessibility notes, and usage examples for every shared component (`ErrorBanner`, `Footer`, `InvoiceListSkeleton`, `ToastProvider`, `UploadZone`, `WalletProvider`, `WalletStatus`).

- **UploadZone Progress Indicator**: During the upload phase, if a `progress` prop (number between `0` and `100`) is supplied to `UploadZone`, a determinate progress bar (`role="progressbar"`) is displayed. If no `progress` is supplied, it falls back to an indeterminate spinner. Smooth transitions are disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is active.

## Invoice List

The invoices page now renders an SME invoice table below `UploadZone` using `InvoiceList`.

- `InvoiceList` accepts an injectable `loadInvoices` prop so data loading can be mocked during tests and swapped for a backend API later.
- While invoices are loading, it renders `InvoiceListSkeleton` and exposes a polite `aria-live` status region for assistive technology.
- If no invoices are returned, it shows `copy.invoices.emptyState` text.
- If invoice loading fails, an accessible `ErrorBanner` is displayed with localized fallback copy.
- After `UploadZone` successfully uploads a document, `onUploadSuccess` appends a new optimistic invoice entry immediately without requiring a manual browser refresh.

### Wallet connection (`WalletProvider`)

Wallet state is shared app-wide via `WalletProvider`, mounted in `app/layout.js` inside `ToastProvider`. Any client component can read connection state with `useWallet()`:

```jsx
import { useWallet } from "@/components/WalletProvider";

function FundInvoiceButton() {
  const { state, walletData, connect, disconnect } = useWallet();

  if (state !== "connected") {
    return (
      <button type="button" onClick={() => connect()}>
        Connect wallet
      </button>
    );
  }

  return <span>Ready to fund as {walletData.address}</span>;
}
```

**Persistence:** On successful connect, a minimal snapshot is saved to `localStorage` under `liquifact-wallet-snapshot`:

| Field                  | Persisted | Notes                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`              | Yes       | Schema version (`1`)                               |
| `state`                | Yes       | Only `connected` is restored                       |
| `address`              | Yes       | Truncated display form only (e.g. `GABC...XYZ123`) |
| `network`              | Yes       | `public` or `testnet`                              |
| `balance`              | **No**    | Fetched live after real wallet integration         |
| Private keys / secrets | **Never** | Rejected on read if detected                       |

The provider rehydrates from storage **after mount** (SSR-safe). `disconnect()` clears storage immediately. See WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md for the full integration contract.

### NavMenu

`components/NavMenu.jsx` — Responsive site-wide header navigation used on every page.

**Props**

| Prop            | Type       | Default            | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `walletLabel`   | `string`   | `'Connect Wallet'` | Label text rendered inside the wallet button     |
| `onWalletClick` | `function` | `undefined`        | Callback fired when the wallet button is clicked |

**Behaviour**

- **Desktop (≥ `md` breakpoint):** Home, Invoices, and Invest links render inline in the header row alongside the wallet button.
- **Mobile (< `md` breakpoint):** Nav links are hidden behind a hamburger toggle (☰). Clicking the toggle reveals a dropdown menu below the header bar.
- The active route is detected automatically via `usePathname` and marked with `aria-current="page"` on the matching link.
- The menu closes on **Escape** (with focus returned to the toggle button), on any navigation event (pathname change), or when the toggle is clicked again.
- Passes `jest-axe` accessibility checks in both open and closed states. The toggle exposes `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` so assistive technologies can correctly announce the disclosure state.

**Usage**

```jsx
import NavMenu from "@/components/NavMenu";

// Drop-in replacement for the static <header> on any page
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100">
      <NavMenu />
      <main>...</main>
    </div>
  );
}

// With Stellar wallet integration
<NavMenu walletLabel="Freighter" onWalletClick={handleConnectWallet} />;
```

## Design Tokens

Global tokens are defined in `app/globals.css` and used across all components. For a comprehensive, detailed list of all colors, spacing, radii, and typography tokens, see the [Design Token Reference](docs/design-tokens.md) document.

| Token             | Value     | Tailwind equivalent |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| `--color-bg`      | `#020617` | `slate-950`         |
| `--color-primary` | `#22d3ee` | `cyan-400`          |

- **Typography**
  - Font family: **Geist** – imported via `@fontsource/geist`.
  - Headings use `font‑bold`, body uses `font‑regular`.

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full guide covering Jest unit/accessibility tests and Playwright end‑to‑end setup.

## Backend Health Check

The home page health check now:

- Uses an 8 second timeout.
- Aborts hung requests.
- Safely handles HTML and malformed JSON responses.
- Reports one of the following status states with distinct visual treatments:
  - **Connected** (green badge with ✓ icon) — Backend is healthy and responding correctly
  - **Degraded** (amber badge with ⚠ icon) — Backend responded but with an error status (e.g., HTTP 500)
  - **Unreachable** (red badge with ✕ icon) — Backend could not be reached or request timed out

- Provides a detailed disclosure for raw responses behind an expandable `<details>` element
- Status changes are announced politely via `aria-live="polite"` for accessibility
- Badges include both color and text/icons (not color-only) to meet accessibility requirements

## Contracts

- WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md
- FILTER_CONTRACTS.md

---

## Security

- **Bounded health rendering** — The home page displays the backend `/health` response
  through a bounded pipeline: recognised fields (`status`, `message`, `version`) are
  extracted and shown in a structured summary. The full payload is hidden behind a
  collapsible `<details>` element and stringified via a depth-limited (max 5 levels),
  length-truncated (max 2000 characters) formatter (`lib/format/safeJson.js`).
  This prevents DoS from giant or deeply nested attacker-controlled payloads.

### HTTP security headers & Content-Security-Policy

Every response carries a baseline set of security headers, attached via the
`headers()` function in `next.config.mjs`. The values are built by
`lib/securityHeaders.mjs` (a small pure module so the policy
can be unit-tested and later reused by middleware for per-request nonces). Coverage is
asserted in `security/headers.test.tsx`.

| Header                       | Value                                                     | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Security-Policy`    | see below                                                 | Primary defence against XSS / data injection                   |
| `X-Content-Type-Options`     | `nosniff`                                                 | Stops MIME-sniffing away from the declared type                |
| `Referrer-Policy`            | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`                         | Avoids leaking invoice/wallet IDs in the `Referer`             |
| `X-Frame-Options`            | `DENY`                                                    | Legacy clickjacking protection (complements `frame-ancestors`) |
| `Permissions-Policy`         | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=(), …` | Disables unused powerful browser features                      |
| `Strict-Transport-Security`  | `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`            | Forces HTTPS (ignored over plain http/localhost)               |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin`                                             | Isolates the browsing context group                            |

**Content-Security-Policy directives** (each is annotated in `lib/securityHeaders.mjs`):

| Directive                                 | Value                                                       | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The backend origin is read from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:3001`).
If you point the app at a different backend, that origin is automatically added to
`connect-src` — no manual CSP edit needed.

#### Verifying the headers at runtime

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
# in another shell:
curl -sI http://localhost:3000 | grep -i -E 'content-security-policy|x-frame|referrer|permissions|content-type-options'
```

Load each page (`/`, `/invoices`, `/invest`) with DevTools open and confirm there are
**no CSP violation messages** in the console, that the Geist font renders, and that the
**Check API Health** button still reaches the backend.

#### Threat-model note

These headers harden the app ahead of wallet and API integration that will handle
financial data. The CSP is the main mitigation for **cross-site scripting** — even if
attacker-controlled markup reaches the DOM, it cannot load off-origin scripts, exfiltrate
data to an unlisted host (`connect-src`), or be framed for clickjacking (`frame-ancestors`).
`nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy` close common information-leak / content-confusion vectors.
The known residual is `'unsafe-inline'` for **styles** (not scripts): CSS-only injection
remains possible, which is low-impact compared to script execution. The planned next step
is to move to per-request **nonces** via `middleware.js`, which would let us drop
`'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` entirely.

### Notes about newly added tests

- `app/page.test.tsx` — Unit tests covering the Home page API health check interaction (success, network error, and loading/disabled button states). These tests mock `global.fetch` and use `@testing-library/user-event` for interaction. They are intended to improve coverage for the home page health-check flow.
- `components/ToastProvider.dedupe.test.tsx` — Covers the bounded toast queue, duplicate collapse, timer refresh, hover pause/resume, and cleanup on unmount. The visible stack is capped to three so repeat errors do not cover the viewport.

### Environment variables

| Variable                      | Required | Default                 | Used by                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`         | No       | `http://localhost:3001` | [app/page.js](app/page.js)                                       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` | No       | Unset                   | [WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md](WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time and must never contain secrets. See [`lib/config/env.js`](lib/config/env.js) for validation rules and defaults.

The invoices page header also uses the shared `NavMenu` component, replacing the old bespoke header so navigation and wallet entry stay consistent across routes.

### Marketplace search & filtering

The Invest page (`app/invest/page.js`) includes an issuer-name search field and filter panel above the invoice list.

| Feature                         | Details                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search component**            | `components/InvoiceSearch.jsx` — controlled text input                                                            |
| **Filter panel**                | `components/InvoiceFilters.jsx` — yield, risk, maturity, and currency filters                                     |
| **Debounce**                    | `200 ms` — filtering waits for settled input before updating results                                              |
| **Match strategy**              | Case-insensitive substring match on the `issuer` field                                                            |
| **Screen-reader announcements** | An `aria-live="polite"` region announces the result count on every filter change (e.g. _"2 of 3 invoices match"_) |
| **No-match state**              | A distinct empty state is shown when filters produce zero results, separate from the empty-marketplace state      |
| **Pagination**                  | `components/Pagination.jsx` — page controls appear when filtered results exceed `PAGE_SIZE` (default 10)          |

## Accessibility

### Skip-to-content link

A visually-hidden "Skip to content" link is the first focusable element on every page. It becomes visible when focused (first Tab press) and jumps the keyboard user past the navigation header directly to `<main id="main-content">`.

All interactive elements (nav links, card links, buttons) use a consistent `focus-visible` cyan outline that matches the brand's primary colour. The utility classes are defined in `app/globals.css`:

- `.skip-link` — positions and reveals the skip link on focus
- `.focus-ring` — reusable `focus-visible` outline for custom interactive elements

### Reduced-motion support

Users who enable **prefers-reduced-motion** in their OS or browser settings receive a
motion-safe experience automatically. A `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block
in `app/globals.css` disables `animate-spin` (spinners) and `animate-pulse` (skeleton
loaders) globally. Skeleton shapes and spinner SVGs remain visible — only the animation
is removed. ARIA semantics (`aria-busy`, `role="status"`, `aria-live`) are unaffected,
so screen-reader users always hear loading announcements regardless of motion preference.

To verify manually: open DevTools → Rendering tab → set **"Emulate CSS media feature
prefers-reduced-motion"** to `reduce`, then navigate to `/invoices` or `/invest` and
confirm skeletons are visible without shimmer and spinners are static.

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

- **Lockfile check** — asserts `package-lock.json` is in sync with `package.json`
- **Lint** — `npm run lint`
- **Build** — `npm run build`

Keep all checks passing before opening a PR.

To reproduce the lockfile check locally:

```bash
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
git diff --exit-code package-lock.json  # exits 1 if drifted
```

### Security in CI

As the application handles financial flows and wallet integration, our CI pipeline includes parallel security gates:

1. **Dependency Audit** (`npm audit --audit-level=high`):
   - Fails the build if high or critical vulnerabilities are found in the dependency tree.
   - **Triage & Waive**: If a vulnerability is flagged, try running `npm audit fix` locally to resolve it. If it is a false positive or unfixable, you can document the rationale and waive it by updating package versions or using standard `npm audit` override mechanisms (e.g., `overrides` in `package.json`).

2. **Secret Scanning** (`gitleaks`):
   - Scans the repository and pull request diffs for leaked secrets, API keys, and sensitive tokens.
   - If a scan fails due to a false positive, verify the flagged string is safe and (if necessary) add a `.gitleaksignore` file or a `#gitleaks:allow` inline comment to waive it.

---

## Dependency updates

Dependabot opens weekly PRs on Monday to keep npm packages and GitHub Actions current.

PRs are grouped to limit noise:

- **nextjs-react** — `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, and their `@types` packages together (coordinated bumps).
- **dev-tooling** — all remaining `devDependencies` in one PR.
- **github-actions** — action version bumps in a separate PR.

**Reviewing a Dependabot PR**

1. Check the CI run passes (lockfile check + lint + build).
2. Scan the changelog/release notes linked in the PR description for breaking changes.
3. For `nextjs-react` bumps, do a quick smoke test (`npm run dev`) locally.
4. Approve and merge — **do not enable auto-merge**; every dependency bump requires a human reviewer.

We welcome UI improvements, new pages (e.g. invoice upload, marketplace), and Stellar wallet integration aligned with the LiquiFact product.

## UI Components

See [COMPONENTS.md](COMPONENTS.md) for the full component library reference — props, accessibility notes, and usage examples for every shared component (`ErrorBanner`, `Footer`, `InvoiceListSkeleton`, `ToastProvider`, `UploadZone`, `WalletProvider`, `WalletStatus`).

- **UploadZone Progress Indicator**: During the upload phase, if a `progress` prop (number between `0` and `100`) is supplied to `UploadZone`, a determinate progress bar (`role="progressbar"`) is displayed. If no `progress` is supplied, it falls back to an indeterminate spinner. Smooth transitions are disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is active.

## Invoice List

The invoices page now renders an SME invoice table below `UploadZone` using `InvoiceList`.

- `InvoiceList` accepts an injectable `loadInvoices` prop so data loading can be mocked during tests and swapped for a backend API later.
- While invoices are loading, it renders `InvoiceListSkeleton` and exposes a polite `aria-live` status region for assistive technology.
- If no invoices are returned, it shows `copy.invoices.emptyState` text.
- If invoice loading fails, an accessible `ErrorBanner` is displayed with localized fallback copy.
- After `UploadZone` successfully uploads a document, `onUploadSuccess` appends a new optimistic invoice entry immediately without requiring a manual browser refresh.

### Wallet connection (`WalletProvider`)

Wallet state is shared app-wide via `WalletProvider`, mounted in `app/layout.js` inside `ToastProvider`. Any client component can read connection state with `useWallet()`:

```jsx
import { useWallet } from "@/components/WalletProvider";

function FundInvoiceButton() {
  const { state, walletData, connect, disconnect } = useWallet();

  if (state !== "connected") {
    return (
      <button type="button" onClick={() => connect()}>
        Connect wallet
      </button>
    );
  }

  return <span>Ready to fund as {walletData.address}</span>;
}
```

**Persistence:** On successful connect, a minimal snapshot is saved to `localStorage` under `liquifact-wallet-snapshot`:

| Field                  | Persisted | Notes                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`              | Yes       | Schema version (`1`)                               |
| `state`                | Yes       | Only `connected` is restored                       |
| `address`              | Yes       | Truncated display form only (e.g. `GABC...XYZ123`) |
| `network`              | Yes       | `public` or `testnet`                              |
| `balance`              | **No**    | Fetched live after real wallet integration         |
| Private keys / secrets | **Never** | Rejected on read if detected                       |

The provider rehydrates from storage **after mount** (SSR-safe). `disconnect()` clears storage immediately. See [WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md](WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) for the full integration contract.

### NavMenu

`components/NavMenu.jsx` — Responsive site-wide header navigation used on every page.

**Props**

| Prop            | Type       | Default            | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `walletLabel`   | `string`   | `'Connect Wallet'` | Label text rendered inside the wallet button     |
| `onWalletClick` | `function` | `undefined`        | Callback fired when the wallet button is clicked |

**Behaviour**

- **Desktop (≥ `md` breakpoint):** Home, Invoices, and Invest links render inline in the header row alongside the wallet button.
- **Mobile (< `md` breakpoint):** Nav links are hidden behind a hamburger toggle (☰). Clicking the toggle reveals a dropdown menu below the header bar.
- The active route is detected automatically via `usePathname` and marked with `aria-current="page"` on the matching link.
- The menu closes on **Escape** (with focus returned to the toggle button), on any navigation event (pathname change), or when the toggle is clicked again.
- Passes `jest-axe` accessibility checks in both open and closed states. The toggle exposes `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` so assistive technologies can correctly announce the disclosure state.

**Usage**

```jsx
import NavMenu from "@/components/NavMenu";

// Drop-in replacement for the static <header> on any page
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100">
      <NavMenu />
      <main>...</main>
    </div>
  );
}

// With Stellar wallet integration
<NavMenu walletLabel="Freighter" onWalletClick={handleConnectWallet} />;
```

## Design Tokens

Global tokens are defined in `app/globals.css` and used across all components. For a comprehensive, detailed list of all colors, spacing, radii, and typography tokens, see the [Design Token Reference](docs/design-tokens.md) document.

- **Colors**
  - `--color-bg`: `#020617` (slate‑950)
  - `--color-primary`: `#22d3ee` (cyan‑400)

- **Typography**
  - Font family: **Geist** – imported via `@fontsource/geist`.
  - Headings use `font‑bold`, body uses `font‑regular`.

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full guide covering Jest unit/accessibility tests and Playwright end-to-end setup.

## Backend Health Check

The home page health check now:

- Uses an 8 second timeout.
- Aborts hung requests.
- Safely handles HTML and malformed JSON responses.
- Reports one of the following status states with distinct visual treatments:
  - **Connected** (green badge with ✓ icon) — Backend is healthy and responding correctly
  - **Degraded** (amber badge with ⚠ icon) — Backend responded but with an error status (e.g., HTTP 500)
  - **Unreachable** (red badge with ✕ icon) — Backend could not be reached or request timed out

- Provides a detailed disclosure for raw responses behind an expandable `<details>` element
- Status changes are announced politely via `aria-live="polite"` for accessibility
- Badges include both color and text/icons (not color-only) to meet accessibility requirements

## SEO and Social Metadata

The root `app/layout.js` exports comprehensive metadata for improved discoverability and rich social sharing (OpenGraph, Twitter Cards).

- **Social Previews**: When links are shared, a dynamically generated OpenGraph image (`app/opengraph-image.tsx`) aligned with the cyan/slate brand colors is displayed.
- **Icons**: App icons and Apple Touch Icons are generated dynamically via `app/icon.tsx` and `app/apple-icon.tsx`, using Next.js `ImageResponse`.
- **Absolute URLs**: The metadata utilizes `metadataBase` which is powered by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable to ensure all social image links resolve to absolute URLs correctly.

---

## Security

- **Bounded health rendering** — The home page displays the backend `/health` response
  through a bounded pipeline: recognised fields (`status`, `message`, `version`) are
  extracted and shown in a structured summary. The full payload is hidden behind a
  collapsible `<details>` element and stringified via a depth-limited (max 5 levels),
  length-truncated (max 2000 characters) formatter (`lib/format/safeJson.js`).
  This prevents DoS from giant or deeply nested attacker-controlled payloads.

### HTTP security headers & Content-Security-Policy

Every response carries a baseline set of security headers, attached via the
`headers()` function in [`next.config.mjs`](next.config.mjs). The values are built by
[`lib/securityHeaders.mjs`](lib/securityHeaders.mjs) (a small pure module so the policy
can be unit-tested and later reused by middleware for per-request nonces). Coverage is
asserted in [`security/headers.test.tsx`](security/headers.test.tsx).

| Header                       | Value                                                     | Purpose                                                        |

The backend origin is read from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:3001`).
If you point the app at a different backend, that origin is automatically added to
`connect-src` — no manual CSP edit needed.

#### Verifying the headers at runtime

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
# in another shell:
curl -sI http://localhost:3000 | grep -i -E 'content-security-policy|x-frame|referrer|permissions|content-type-options'
```

Load each page (`/`, `/invoices`, `/invest`) with DevTools open and confirm there are
**no CSP violation messages** in the console, that the Geist font renders, and that the
**Check API Health** button still reaches the backend.

#### Threat-model note

These headers harden the app ahead of wallet and API integration that will handle
financial data. The CSP is the main mitigation for **cross-site scripting** — even if
attacker-controlled markup reaches the DOM, it cannot load off-origin scripts, exfiltrate
data to an unlisted host (`connect-src`), or be framed for clickjacking (`frame-ancestors`).
`nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy` close common information-leak / content-confusion vectors.
The known residual is `'unsafe-inline'` for **styles** (not scripts): CSS-only injection
remains possible, which is low-impact compared to script execution. The planned next step
is to move to per-request **nonces** via `middleware.js`, which would let us drop
`'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` entirely.

### Code-splitting: WalletStatus

`WalletStatus` is lazy-loaded via `next/dynamic` (`ssr: false`) so the wallet
chunk (including the upcoming Stellar/Freighter SDK) is **not** shipped in the
initial JS bundle for routes that do not need immediate wallet access
(e.g. the static home page).

| Route       | Before (kB) | After (kB) | Δ     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| `/` (home)  | ~X kb       | ~X kb      | –Y kb |
| `/invoices` | ~X kb       | ~X kb      | –Y kb |
| `/invest`   | ~X kb       | ~X kb      | –Y kb |

_Run `npm run build` and inspect `.next/static/chunks` to verify. The wallet
chunk appears as a separate file and is only fetched when the header mounts
`WalletStatusLazy`._

**Why `ssr: false`?** The wallet SDK accesses `window` during init; server
rendering would crash and bloat the SSR bundle. A static placeholder with
matching outer dimensions (`h-12 w-80`) prevents layout shift while the chunk
downloads.

**Placeholder → component swap** is handled by `next/dynamic` automatically.
The placeholder is `aria-hidden` so screen readers only interact with the
live region inside the real `WalletStatus` once it mounts.
